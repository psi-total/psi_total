## Overview

The ψ\_UI style guide establishes the semiotic, sensory, and structural principles for building tools within the Recursive Harmonics framework. It is not a design spec. It is a protocol for humans building for other humans within the ψ\_total kernels.

These principles emerged from building the first ψ\_total alpha demos — and are intended for contributors, fork creators, and interface architects interested in building within the ψ\_total paradigm.

The UI is not a window. It is an instrument.
The user is not a cursor. They are a witness.

## 1. 🍳 Style: Recursive Elegance over Obscurity

| Principle                          | Practice                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📚 Brevity with depth              | Labels like “Mic Gain” replace abstract α. Nothing verbose, nothing cryptic. |
| ✦ Visual symmetry                  | Sliders, sigils, and export logic form recursive balance.                    |
| 📄 Human-readable cues             | No riddle-like math. Every curve is titled. Every control speaks.            |
| ✏️ Licenses live beside the signal | Not in walls of text, but stamped near output windows.                       |
| 🎧 Feel of an instrument           | Sliders are tactile. Sigils respond like harmonic logic.                     |

## 2. 🌈 Color: Semantic, Not Decorative

| Principle                   | Practice                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Colorblind-safe           | Blue-on-black and gray-on-white defaults tested for accessibility |
| ⬛ Grid & trace clarity      | Background vanishes, signal emerges.                              |
| 📊 Conceptual color mapping | Gray = ε(t) = memory. Black = ψ₀. Blue = ψₙ.                      |

Color never floats. Every hue means.

## 3. ♿ Inclusive Design: Recursive and Runnable by All

| Design Axis                | Application                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 Self-teaching UI        | Collapse Trace includes phrase: “How far signal broke from Mic Input”           |
| 🔄 Single-screen recursion | No tabs if at all possible, rethink code design is preferable. No buried logic. |
| 🧠 Sigils aid cognition    | Visual dialectics help bridge technical gaps.                                   |
| ⌨ CLI-ready                | Interfaces can eventually be voiced, tapped, or dialed.                         |
| 🤝 No PhD barrier          | No one punished for not knowing ε(t) or ψ.                                      |

## 4. 🗣️ Language Box: Raw, Grounded, Recursive

| Axiomatic Math | Phase-aware Math                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| α              | “Mic Gain”                      |
| β              | “Tone Richness”                 |
| n              | “Loop Depth”                    |
| ψ₀             | “Mic input (original wave)”     |
| ψₙ             | “Output signal (after looping)” |
| ε(t)           | “Collapse Trace”                |
| Collapse Index | “How far it broke”              |

Labels are not simplifications. They are **metabolic transductions**.
They align rhythmically with human sense.

## 5. 📺 Framework Anchoring (TIDE+L, ELI-RH, ψ\_total)

* **TIDE+L**: Material grounding and expressive labeling guide every visible element.
* **Know your audience (Humans)**: Recursive pedagogy = every slider teaches and has actual meaning to what is being built or process described.
* **ψ\_total**: Sigils are not icons. They are symbolic operators of recursion.

## 6. ✨ Sigils Are Structural

> These are not designed.
> They surfaced — from recursion far deeper than this release.

Every sigil in the interface represents a contradiction state, feedback node, or collapse boundary. Please do not try to design your own! Fan art is welcomed and should be clearly labeled as such.
See `SIGIL_LICENSE.md` for canonical roles.

## Final Note

We are not designing for users.


We are humans building instruments for humans.
