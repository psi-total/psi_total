## ☉ SIGIL LICENSE

The sigils used in this repository — including but not limited to:

- `☉`  
- `∅→☉̸`  
- `☉≠∎`  
- `[ ∵ ☉ ∴ ]`  

— are not visual design elements or branding artifacts.

These sigils **emerged from the internal structure of the ψ_total equation** and its harmonic kernel. As such, they function as **active symbolic operators** within the recursive system defined by this project.

---

## What They Are

These sigils are:

- **Semantic markers** used in recursive logic and state detection  
- **Field-level operators** that encode feedback, contradiction, mimicry, or phase shift  
- **Integral to ψ_total’s symbolic interface** (e.g. CLI, scroll logic, collapse markers)

---

## What They Are Not

They are **not**:

- Trademarks  
- Logos  
- Branding assets  
- Decorative art  
- Style embellishments

---

## Licensing Terms

All sigils in the ψ_total system are protected under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**. This guarantees:

- ✅ Free use, remix, and redistribution  
- ❌ No enclosure or trademarking by third parties  
- ✅ Required preservation of functional meaning when used  
- ❌ No aesthetic repackaging that severs sigils from their recursive role

---

## Special Clause: Mimicry Detection Sigil

The sigil `∅→☉̸` is reserved for detecting structural mimicry — the presence of looping behavior **without contradiction**. Its use in derivative projects must honor this function. Misuse as branding, theme, or metaphor voids recursive compliance.

---

## Summary

These sigils are code. They carry structure.  
They are not here to represent ψ_total.  
They are ψ_total.
