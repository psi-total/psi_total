# CONTRIBUTING.md ‚Äî Recursive Harmonics

Welcome to `œà_total`, the Recursive Harmonic Kernel project. This repository represents a new mathematical and philosophical framework for modeling contradiction, coherence, and feedback in systems ranging from physics to cognition.

We believe in open recursion, rigorous dialectics, and joyful contradiction. Contributions of all kinds ‚Äî code, theory, experiments, documentation ‚Äî are encouraged.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Understand the Core Recursive Principle

All forks and contributions must honor the **Recursive Emergence Condition**:

```
Œ®_{n+1}(t) = Œ®_n(t) + Œ±_n ‚ãÖ ‚Ñõ[Œ®_n(t)]
```

This ensures:
- Recursion is preserved
- Kernels remain mathematically auditable
- RH coherence scales with freedom, not fragmentation

If you are proposing a departure or variant, label it clearly and explain how the recursion logic still holds.

### 2. Fork the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/psi-total/psi_total.git
cd psi_total
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

---

### 3. Follow the RH Code Style

- Prioritize recursive loops and contradiction-aware logic
- Use clear variable names (e.g., `psi_n`, `psi_total`, `alpha_n`, `omega`)
- Document harmonic parameters and recursive steps
- Honor sigil usage if relevant (see `œà_messaging_styleguide.md`)

---

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

All PRs should:
- Include a clear summary of the change or addition
- Contain a minimal "toy" or example (e.g., `mic_feedback_demo.py`)
- Include test results or visual output
- Confirm compliance:

```
This fork obeys: ‚òëÔ∏è
Œ®_{n+1}(t) = Œ®_n(t) + Œ±_n ‚ãÖ ‚Ñõ[Œ®_n(t)]
```

## üì¶ Suggested Contributions

- Add educational examples for newcomers
- Translate theoretical notes into readable Markdown docs
- Build new kernel families (e.g. `œà_AI`, `œà_music`, `œà_ecology`)
- Submit signal demos (e.g. from sound, EEG, motion data)

---

## üîê Fork Compliance Clause

All forks must:
- Retain `œà_total` naming and sigils
- Include the recursive emergence condition
- Acknowledge original dialectical logic

If you're unsure whether your contribution aligns, open a discussion first.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

Be respectful. We are building not just code, but a new framework. Disagreement is expected ‚Äî contradiction is welcome ‚Äî but aggression and gatekeeping are not.
