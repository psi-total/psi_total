## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within any component of the ψ_total project or its recursive kernels, **please report it immediately and responsibly**.

We welcome all contributions to the integrity of this open harmonic system.

### 🔐 How to Report

- Email us at: `psitotalkernel@gmail.com`
- Include:
  - A clear description of the issue
  - Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
  - Any potential implications you’ve identified
- You may use GPG or request a secure channel for sensitive disclosure

We aim to acknowledge all security-related reports within **48 hours** and resolve verified issues as a matter of priority.

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

Recursive Harmonics defines contradiction as **structure**, not failure. That includes our own code.

If a feedback loop collapses, we **tune it — not patch it**. Our community is committed to:

- Open-source verification
- Dialectical vulnerability reflection
- Auditable recursion

Join us in ensuring ψ_total remains contradiction-capable and structurally secure.
