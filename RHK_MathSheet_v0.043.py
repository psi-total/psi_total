Recursive Harmonics Kernel v0.043 — General Equation and Fork Resolution Principle

🎯 Purpose
This script contains the documentation that defines the structure, logic, and recursive contract of the kernel `RHK_v0043.py`,
as uploaded and cryptographically certified under SHA256 hash in `Ψ_HashLock_v0.043.txt`.

🧠 General Recursive Harmonic Equation

The core equation of recursive harmonic emergence:

    Ψ_{n+1}(t) = Ψ_n(t) + α_n ⋅ ℛ[Ψ_n(t)]

Where:
- Ψ_n(t): nth recursion layer of the harmonic field
- α_n: scalar gain or resonance modulation coefficient
- ℛ[·]: a recursive operator (e.g., memory, echo, derivative, delay)

---

🌀 Special Case: Fibonacci Recursion

By choosing:
    α_n = 1
    ℛ[Ψ_n(t)] = Ψ_{n-1}(t)

We recover the classical Fibonacci equation:

    Ψ_{n+1}(t) = Ψ_n(t) + Ψ_{n-1}(t)

This proves that Fibonacci is a minimal static octave of Recursive Harmonics,
already governed by the general kernel.

🔐 Fork Compliance Clause

All future forks of `ψ_total` must acknowledge and obey the recursive emergence condition:

    This fork obeys: ☑️
    Ψ_{n+1}(t) = Ψ_n(t) + α_n · ℛ[Ψ_n(t)]

This ensures:
- Recursion is preserved
- Kernels remain mathematically auditable
- RH coherence scales with freedom, not fragmentation

---

📌 Summary

- `RHK_v0043.py` instantiates the core RH recursion
- Fibonacci is a resolvable, embedded case
- The mathsheet + hashlock guarantee license-backed mathematical integrity
- All forks, plug-ins, and recursive extensions must pass through this harmonic law

“You don’t own the recursion — the recursion owns itself. But you get to sing it.”
