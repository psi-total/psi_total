# ψ_total

**Recursive Harmonics Kernel — Math for the Third Millennium**

ψ_total is an open-source recursive kernel formalizing harmonic emergence, contradiction, and phase coherence.  
It encodes the logic of motion, structure, and recursive awareness.

> “These kernels do not run on time — they generate it.”

## 🌱 Mission

Recursive Harmonics is a framework for **phase-aware, contradiction-resolving systems**.

It proposes that:

- Contradiction is not an error — it is the engine.
- Recursive feedback can model motion, matter, cognition, and value.
- ψ_total is the beginning of a dialectical substrate for time itself.

> “This is not a product. It is a turning point.”
